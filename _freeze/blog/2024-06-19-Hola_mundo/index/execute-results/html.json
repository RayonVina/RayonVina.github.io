I have built this web using [Posit (RStudio) Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (in R obviously) almost as an experiment, using only Rstudio Desktop, some time and a lot of patience.\\\nI have to thank [Silvia Canelón](https://silviacanelon.com/about/) for leaving her github repository with the source code of her magnificent web open so that the rest of us can ~~copy~~ inspire from her to make our own.\n\nI doubt that I will post regularly, because I have never done it, but I will try to post here curiosities that I am working with and that I consider worthwhile. What I do have quite clear is that I will continue making changes and improvements to this web.\n\n![](featured_full.gif){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n[← Back to the blog](../index.qmd)\n",
